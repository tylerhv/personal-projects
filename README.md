There is this YouTuber who I have enjoyed watching over the years, his name is Anthony Fantano (or theneedledrop) and has given great music recomendations over the years.
Every week, he uploads a video called "Weekly Track Roundup" and in the description, there is a set format he follows:

(Bunch of links to sponsors)
"BEST TRACK OF THE WEEK" (followed by song/artist name, the next line being the link to the song)
"Meh..." (same here)
"Worst track of the week" (same here)
 
The goal was to automatically add in only the songs under the "BEST TRACKS OF THE WEEK" into my spotify playlist, that way I don't have to manually add it every week myself
Using RegEx, Youtube Api, and the Spotify Api, I was able to achieve that.
 
This file has my client secret, youtube api key, amongst other things removed.
